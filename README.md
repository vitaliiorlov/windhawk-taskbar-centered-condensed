## 🛠 Source Code

The actual mod code is split into files under [
`mod-parts/`](https://github.com/DarkionAvey/windhawk-taskbar-centered-condensed/blob/main/mod-parts/), which are later merged together using a Python script.

❗ **Do not edit `assembled-mod.cpp` manually**, as any changes will be overwritten in the next build cycle. Instead,
modify the source files in the `mod-parts` directory.
